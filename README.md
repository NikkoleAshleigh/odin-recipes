# odin-recipes
Write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)

In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website. The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes with maybe a little CSS, but this project will be revisited in the future to style it up.
